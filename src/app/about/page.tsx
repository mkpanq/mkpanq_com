            Hi, I&apos;m Marek, a product developer from Warsaw, Poland,
            passionate about creating sophisticated digital products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I have developed extensive experience in taking
            digital products from conceptualization to initial release,
            contributing at every stage of the development cycle. I&apos;ve had
            the opportunity to work in both software houses and product
            companies, which has allowed me to hone my skills in various areas
            of product development, including UX/UI design, human-machine
            communication, and end-to-end product delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love motorsports, particularly Formula 1, Playstation gaming and
            basketball. I&apos;m also trying to get into the world of
            photography and video creation.
