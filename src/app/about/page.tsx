            Hi, I&apos;m Marek, a product developer from Warsaw, Poland,
            passionate about creating sophisticated digital products. Over the
            years, I have developed extensive experience in taking digital
            products from conceptualization to initial release, contributing at
            every stage of the development cycle. I&apos;ve had the opportunity
            to work in both software houses and product companies, which has
            allowed me to hone my skills in various areas of product
            development, including UX/UI design, human-machine communication,
            and end-to-end product delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love motorsports, particularly Formula 1, Playstation gaming and
            basketball. I&apos;m also trying to get into the world of
            photography and video creation.
