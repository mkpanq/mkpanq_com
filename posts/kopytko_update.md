### I've stopped counting

The biggest problem with all personal projects is lack of time. Or to be more precise - a longer, unpredictable break from coding an app, which makes you abandon your project. How many times have you had a huge coding flow and were creating something ambitious, to just leave it for about a few weeks? After coming back you look at this and it’s just “meeeeeh, just archive it”.
I stopped counting. It’s painful, demotivating, and harmful.

So that’s why I published my latest repository called [Kopytko](https://github.com/mkpanq/kopytko). Let me introduce what is it, what the initial idea was, and how it ended.

Kopytko was an idea that grew in my head for a while - a small, React + HonoJS monorepo app to save and report the development progress of your pet projects. Nice idea to develop a small app, which could bring some joy and relaxation.

Well… yes. But actually **no**.

### Ambition is harmfull

Being too ambitious and trying to polish every small aspect of code, instead of just writing the simplest business logic and ship it, striked again. In addition, trying to figure out some things with Hono, Drizzle, and other frameworks to make this solution as perfect as possible led to 3 week of coding without ANY ready solution. That led to anxiety, boredom, and general tiredness of this project. I’ve decided to abandon this project, leave it for a while, and try to take care of something else.
But I already knew, what possible outcome of it would be like - another quitting.

That’s why… Kopytko became something. And nothing at the same time. Just a “scratchpad repo”, with example implementations of Turborepo project architecture with well-known frameworks and libraries.
Scratchpad repo - that’s how I called it. And make it public. Added readme file started like this:

_Kopytko is my first, initial approach to creating “The scratchpad repository”. Repositories like this are mainly for creating, experimenting, and learning new frameworks and technologies. This application has no special purpose - it is just a simple backend-frontend application with many different libraries implemented at once to check how they would be suitable for my future applications. A huge part of this code looks terrible or even does not work - in some places I’ve added TODOs for myself to make some improvements.
Maybe someday this app will turn into something, maybe not. Is just my playground for future use. But, maybe here you will find something interesting for yourself, or just Github Copilot will make a useful hint based on this.
If you are going to use even a small part of this code in production you must be very brave, very stupid, or just want to sabotage your own application/company - do not know what’s worse._

Maybe some of you (if not all of you) would think “for what”?

For the sake of showing that any work that has been done. Right now I do not feel angry. I do not feel tired or disappointed. Maybe Kopytko hasn’t become the app I wanted it to be. But I’ve shown it to the world, describing all the pros, cons, mistakes, TODOs, and right now, I feel I haven’t abandoned anything. Making this repo public, I’ve promised myself, that this project will be alive and will make a contribution to the community, even by showing simple HonoJS JWT implementation, or Tanstack Router architecture - maybe somebody, someday will use it for learning, or GH Copilot will make better code completion using it.

Kopytko is alive - it’s public. I do not feel the pressure to end this for all costs, to show to the public - I’ve already done it. And even if right now I feel a little bit tired because of it and want to take a little break from this code, I’m more than sure that I will come back to it. Maybe not this week, or this month. But I’ll guess the idea of this repo and what it became is something that will force me to come back to it, to make more improvements with time.

We’ll see how it ends. But to be honest, this is really refreshing - I do not have a sense of wasted time, and proof of my work and any learning process is public and visible.
I haven’t made any app. I just wrote some code. But damn, It’s satisfying.

See u soon\
