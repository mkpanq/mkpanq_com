### Yes, I know that those titles are quite… philosophical. But let me explain.

For about three days I’ve been learning from a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXyTIQOfTTk) prepared by [Sam Meech-Ward](https://www.sammeechward.com/) about creating full-stack applications using React, Bun, HonoJS, Tanstack, and lot more famous frontend frameworks and libraries. If you have a little time just take a look - the guy’s very talented and the way he explains every step in development it’s really good. Clear, simple, well-explained software development video - that’s what we love, do we?\
The video is about three hours long. And some of you would think _“3 hours ? In 3 days ? And you’re not even finished ?”_. Yup, I’m not. But not because I’m a lazy piece of a$$ (ok, that’s too, but it’s not the main reason), but because after about one hour of it, I’ve stopped following this tutorial step by step and… yes, **got off the track**.

### Favorite

First of all - no matter what tutorial or content creator you’re in, they present just ONE way to solve the problem. I’m not saying it’s wrong - everyone has their best and favorite ways to create applications, using libraries they like, etc. Thanks to them we can get to know new techniques or frameworks and that’s cool.\
But, as I mentioned in my previous posts, following such tutorials, no matter how long and interesting they are, starts to bear me with time. I’m not learning anything - I’m just **rewriting the code**. And that’s where motivation and satisfaction are lost.

Solution? Try to create it in your way.

- The creator used some 3rd party library to create forms in his app. Great - try to use a **different one**.
- Following the video, we’re using Kinde for authentication. I don’t like it - I’ll try **AuthJS** instead.
- Prisma? Nah, maybe try with **Drizzle** this time.

Just try to do the same, but take a different path and use different tools. After that, compare your implementation with what you see in the video. Learn about mistakes, differences, and other implementation strategies. Use knowledge that you have and the one you’ve just got. And use them in a completely new way. You’ll see the progress and satisfaction will be much bigger.

I’ve learned that one of the most important things in software development is continuous improvement by _**constantly leaving your comfort zone**_. And I can do that by taking other directions to get the same outcome.\
Worth mentioning that this approach is best for longer tutorials that use multiple libraries or frameworks to create full applications, for example, some Twitter clone (thanks to Elon, we need it), a simple CRUD expense tracker, or just an API. When your main objective is to _create_ something, not _learn_ something. If you’re picking up a tutorial about implementing Kinde in your project it doesn’t mean you have to pick AuthJS for just being a rebel - I know it’s obvious, but... You know what I mean ;)

The [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXyTIQOfTTk) I’ve mentioned before (once again huge shoutout to [Sam Meech-Ward](https://www.sammeechward.com/)) made me use my app AuthJS instead of Kinde. Thanks to using HonoJS and React with Tanstack Router at the same time, I think I’ve created some little challenge for myself and maybe fundamentals for a simple tutorial - how to create auth routes in HonoJS and React full stack app using AuthJS. What’s more, there is no official AuthJS package for HonoJS (but there are some custom-made middlewares like [this](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/auth-js#authjs-middleware-for-hono)) what’s make this project more interesting.

So yeah - get off the track. Thanks to that I’ve even created a second blog post! If that’s not the best proof that this approach is working, then I do not know what is.

Peace\
