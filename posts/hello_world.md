### I hate writing.

Yes, I admitted it. I’m not too fond of writing, especially when it’s not in my native language (brzęczyszczykiewicz język is much easier, trust me). But trying to get into streaming or YT video creation was too much time-consuming and (as I know myself well), I would never start it, because I would like to be perfect - camera, studio, surroundings, voice. And at this time it’s impossible to achieve. So that’s why I ended up here. Another “Hello World” blog post.

But I think this time will be much different. Especially after reading this [article](https://ajkprojects.com/stopactinglikeyourefamous)

For some time, after multiple failures with my side projects and “other than development job” activities, I realized, that with my attitude, I would never create anything. From the beginning, a visualization of a ready multi-feature product is the start of a road full of disappointments with multiple abandoned projects at the end.

Why? Because it has to be perfect. But probably will never be, no matter how much time I will try to spend on it.

Since my decision to pivot from backend-heavy Ruby on Rails development to full-stack Typescript engineering and focus much more on the end-user, UX/UI side of the web applications, programming started to bring me much more fun. I’ve always felt that more satisfaction brings me to create things for users and not for frontend applications, trying to optimize database query being faster by 1.5 seconds. I’m not saying backend development is not interesting, or what’s worse, unnecessary. But even with mentioned earlier database query optimization example, my mainly focus was: **_“How it’s gonna affect the end user?”_**


After resigning from my job at the beginning of November’22 to take a break to focus on my mental health, I’ve started to learn new Rails 7 frontend revolutionary tools - Turbo & Hotwire. Do not take me wrong - I love Ruby and its simplicity, I also appreciate the Rails framework and have good memories with them. But since starting to create my first project in it, I realized that I’m spending much more time on UI, than business logic. Creating UI with ERB templates is not hard but… It’s also not great (and nobody at my local software job market uses it). In addition, after a couple of failed job interviews for RoR backend developer, I’ve decided to 100 % pivot into the JS world to get more into React, frontend development, and full-stack product creation. OK, maybe full stack is not the perfect word - product engineer is much better. This [tweet](https://x.com/_swanson/status/1631691930345037824) (I’ve started to write a rant on Elon here, because of this  fu&$%ing “X” revolution) describes this very well. 

But, there was a lot to catch up on (I’ve got experience with frontend tech like React, but not as much as I needed and wanted), so…  I just started web dev tutorials - starting from fundamentals is usually boring but I tried to stay humbled and decided to refresh and reorganize my current knowledge. And from here I want to thank [ByteGrad](https://bytegrad.com/) for his really good CSS, HTML and React courses. It’s worth each dollar.\
It worked initially. But after some time tutorials and “rewriting” code from video to my editor started to become dull and pointless. I didn’t want to fall into “tutorial hell” ([here](https://devszczepaniak.pl/pulapki-nauki/?utm_source=unknownews) is a nice article about it in Polish). I need to create something. From scratch, by myself. It doesn’t need to be perfect. It has to be educational. And satisfying.\
So I’ve decided  - f&$%k it. If I can’t create the perfect product in private, then I’ll try to create shitty products in public.

So here were are. The homepage you’re visiting currently is my first “child”. NextJS, Typerscript, Tailwind, and other cool, trendy front-end stuff. I’m very proud of it, during that process I really liked the NextJS environment and it’s related community.

I decided to create more. In public, trying to keep you updated about everything I’ve done - project, improvements, my thoughts, etc. [Learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). Fail, show, discuss, get feedback, improve. The more I’m in this loop, the more I’m sure that’s the proper way to learn and build new things. You’ll never be perfect. Start small and grow. At your own pace. Make this progress satisfying. I’m curious how it will turn out, but to be honest, this is the first time when I have approached that “perfectionism” problem with a completely different attitude. So there is a chance to keep it up!

I feel this pivot was a very good move. I hope I’ll write (maybe talk?) to you soon.

Take care\
